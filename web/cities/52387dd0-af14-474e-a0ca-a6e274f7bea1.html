<h3 id="background">Background Flavor</h3><p>In the center of this village is a perpetual flame spouting from a hole in the ground, which is actually the location of the original well. Below the town is a pocket of gas that's mostly methane. Old Jim Straw lit his pipe at the well 30 years ago and cause an explosion (he was never seen again). The villagers make use of the fire to warm themselves and cook.</p><div class="pageNumber"><p>1</p></div><p></p><p></p><div class="footnote">PAGE 1| Springley<p></p></div></div>
